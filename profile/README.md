# The EOS Power Network

## Primary project

### Pull transactions on EOS

The EOS Power Network (EPN) aims to showcase the power of the EOS public blockchain to the world. Some of the unique features of EOS, including it's permission structure flexibility and native multi-signature transactons, allow for some projects that other "Layer 1" blockchains would be unable to support (without sacrificing some security). One such project is being demonstrated by the EOS Power Network, and it will allow for organizations building on the EOS public blockchain to use pull transactions. This will allow new businesses and new business models to flourish on EOS.

Types of pull transactions included in V1.0 of the EPN:

* Recurring Donations
* Subscriptions

## Ancillary projects

### Developer tooling

The first public project released by the EPN was tooling to ease the process of developing EOS smart contracts using the most up-to-date tooling and technology. The eos.io website maintained by B1 does not contain the latest best-practices for smart contract development targeted to the EOS Public Blockchain.
